00:00:00.121 --> 00:00:01.761
Last season, on The Flash...

2
00:00:01.772 --> 00:00:02.650
Melt.

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.360
- Killer Frost...
- Is gone.

4
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.710
It says there's still another
cryogenic anomaly in my DNA.

5
00:00:08.727 --> 00:00:10.127
Killer Frost is still a part of you.

6
00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:10.838
Hang on.

7
00:00:12.077 --> 00:00:13.533
See, right there.

8
00:00:13.677 --> 00:00:15.631
Killer Frost, she was part of you.

9
00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:16.509
Even then.

10
00:00:17.185 --> 00:00:18.123
How is that possible?

11
00:00:18.371 --> 00:00:20.581
To the newest member of Team Flash.

12
00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:22.029
- Hi.
- Hey.

13
00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:23.020
We need to talk.

14
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.035
- Who are you?
- I'm your daughter, Nora.

15
00:00:25.423 --> 00:00:26.985
Sally's in a decaying orbit.

16
00:00:27.284 --> 00:00:28.270
Okay, how do we stop something

17
00:00:28.281 --> 00:00:29.813
that's going to send us
back into the Stone Age?

18
00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:32.013
Barry, you've got to
destroy that satellite.

19
00:00:33.747 --> 00:00:34.801
That satellite...

20
00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:36.601
it wasn't just me who took it down.

21
00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:37.764
There was another speedster.

22
00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:40.760
Okay, let's back up.

23
00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:43.888
My name is Nora West-Allen,

24
00:00:43.965 --> 00:00:45.765
the fastest woman alive.

25
00:00:45.775 --> 00:00:47.775
When I'm from, 30 years from now,

26
00:00:47.852 --> 00:00:50.019
I'm the guardian of Central City.

27
00:00:50.096 --> 00:00:52.897
I'm a speedster, just like my dad.

28
00:00:52.974 --> 00:00:54.982
People call me XS.

29
00:00:57.103 --> 00:00:59.695
Every day, I hope to live up
to the legacy of The Flash...

30
00:01:03.442 --> 00:01:06.702
But I've still got a long way to go.

31
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.586
You're saying you're our daughter?

32
00:01:15.663 --> 00:01:18.047
From the future?

33
00:01:18.124 --> 00:01:19.757
Named Nora?

34
00:01:19.768 --> 00:01:22.101
After your mother.

35
00:01:23.438 --> 00:01:24.938
Anybody need a refill?

36
00:01:25.756 --> 00:01:27.556
No? Just me?

37
00:01:30.636 --> 00:01:32.019
Cisco Ramon,

38
00:01:32.096 --> 00:01:34.313
always cutting the tension with a joke.

39
00:01:35.683 --> 00:01:36.991
You know our names?

40
00:01:37.068 --> 00:01:39.276
Of course. I know all of you.

41
00:01:39.353 --> 00:01:41.704
You're Caitlin Snow, Ralph Dibny,

42
00:01:41.781 --> 00:01:44.031
Papa Joe, Mama Cecile.

43
00:01:44.108 --> 00:01:45.533
Little Auntie Jenna.

44
00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:46.742
She's so cute.

45
00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:48.035
And Uncle Wally.

46
00:01:48.112 --> 00:01:50.672
And your nickname is XS?

47
00:01:50.748 --> 00:01:52.289
Clearly not my doing.

48
00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:53.833
No, it's a nickname

49
00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.294
that you gave me when I was a kid, Mom.

50
00:01:57.371 --> 00:01:58.921
"Mom"?

51
00:01:58.998 --> 00:02:01.966
You said I did everything in excess.

52
00:02:02.043 --> 00:02:04.260
Guess I've always been like that.

53
00:02:04.336 --> 00:02:06.854
Overdoing things, getting
in way over my head.

54
00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:09.015
Like, recently.

55
00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:10.692
This mistake that you made?

56
00:02:10.768 --> 00:02:11.934
Big mistake.

57
00:02:11.945 --> 00:02:13.319
Which was...

58
00:02:13.396 --> 00:02:14.862
Helping you save the city

59
00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.273
by destroying the STAR
Labs satellite last night.

60
00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.607
You were the other speedster?

61
00:02:18.684 --> 00:02:19.942
I just couldn't stop myself

62
00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.203
from getting involved.

63
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.947
But something happened
when I did, because now,

64
00:02:25.024 --> 00:02:27.950
I can't seem to go fast enough
to open up the Speed Force.

65
00:02:28.027 --> 00:02:29.493
Par... pardon me.

66
00:02:29.504 --> 00:02:31.713
Are we talking about
actual time travel here?

67
00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:34.382
Do you just like, not pay any attention

68
00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:35.875
when we have our briefings?

69
00:02:35.885 --> 00:02:37.835
Y'all didn't teach him
about the Legends?

70
00:02:37.912 --> 00:02:40.171
Look, nobody said bubkes
about time travel.

71
00:02:42.726 --> 00:02:43.966
Come on, Ralph. You're scaring the baby.

72
00:02:43.977 --> 00:02:44.967
Yeah, you're scaring the baby.

73
00:02:46.712 --> 00:02:48.345
No, no, she's not scared.

74
00:02:48.422 --> 00:02:49.805
She just said she's hungry.

75
00:02:51.258 --> 00:02:54.569
She said that she's... Joe!

76
00:02:54.645 --> 00:02:56.020
I heard her!

77
00:02:56.097 --> 00:02:58.314
I read her mind!

78
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.408
I might not be losing my powers!

79
00:03:00.485 --> 00:03:03.569
I might not be losing my powers!

80
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.362
Awesome.

81
00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.198
I'm sorry.

82
00:03:07.274 --> 00:03:09.992
I know how bizarre this must seem,

83
00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.589
meeting your daughter from
the future as an adult.

84
00:03:14.665 --> 00:03:16.758
But really, this wasn't my plan at all,

85
00:03:16.834 --> 00:03:19.668
but I'm kind of stuck here now,

86
00:03:19.745 --> 00:03:22.046
and you're the only
people who can help me.

87
00:03:22.123 --> 00:03:26.175
So... anybody know what to do?

88
00:03:30.754 --> 00:03:33.143
www.TUSUBTITULO.com -DIFUNDE LA CULTURA-

89
00:03:35.904 --> 00:03:41.107
This is so, so weird.

90
00:03:41.117 --> 00:03:46.946
Yeah, I mean, I can't believe
that's our daughter up there.

91
00:03:46.956 --> 00:03:50.407
- We have been lied to before.
- Barry.

92
00:03:50.484 --> 00:03:53.452
Yellow lightning like yours,
purple lightning like mine?

93
00:03:53.463 --> 00:03:55.579
I mean, it's... it's got to be her.

94
00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.293
We're meeting our daughter
for the first time, Barry.

95
00:04:01.304 --> 00:04:03.129
Yeah, well, look. If it is true, Nora

96
00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.257
could say the wrong thing or
step on the wrong butterfly

97
00:04:06.333 --> 00:04:07.975
and screw up the whole timeline.

98
00:04:08.052 --> 00:04:10.136
I mean, she could Marty McFly
herself out of existence.

99
00:04:10.146 --> 00:04:12.263
"Terminator 2." yeah.

100
00:04:14.175 --> 00:04:15.975
No, that's "Back to the"...
It doesn't matter.

101
00:04:15.985 --> 00:04:18.060
Look, we just need to be
responsible, all right?

102
00:04:18.137 --> 00:04:20.229
I mean, I think we need to find
a way to send her home, fast.

103
00:04:20.306 --> 00:04:22.490
Barry, don't you think future
us taught our daughter

104
00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:24.400
how not to screw with the timeline?

105
00:04:26.028 --> 00:04:29.664
Wow, this Speed Lab sure is archaic?

106
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.198
La-la-la-la-la, you don't know...

107
00:04:31.275 --> 00:04:32.825
you know what...

108
00:04:32.836 --> 00:04:34.451
Sorry, just... no future
talk, all right, please?

109
00:04:34.528 --> 00:04:36.996
Right, I don't want to
wreck the timeline.

110
00:04:37.006 --> 00:04:39.331
- Right.
- All right, Nora.

111
00:04:39.342 --> 00:04:41.250
This is gonna link us up
with your biometrics.

112
00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:45.129
And this little scrunchy doohicky

113
00:04:45.206 --> 00:04:48.349
is gonna analyze your
connection to the...

114
00:04:48.426 --> 00:04:49.600
The Speed Force.

115
00:04:49.677 --> 00:04:51.427
The Speed Force. Thank you.

116
00:04:51.503 --> 00:04:52.520
Great.

117
00:04:52.597 --> 00:04:54.597
I'll be back in a... flash.

118
00:04:59.053 --> 00:05:00.528
And what does it say?

119
00:05:00.605 --> 00:05:02.271
A quick analysis of her DNA shows

120
00:05:02.348 --> 00:05:04.523
patterns that are similar
to both of yours.

121
00:05:04.534 --> 00:05:07.234
I knew it. She's our daughter.

122
00:05:07.311 --> 00:05:09.036
What about her being stuck here?

123
00:05:09.113 --> 00:05:10.654
Everything's normal.

124
00:05:10.731 --> 00:05:12.531
She definitely has Speed
Force in her system.

125
00:05:12.542 --> 00:05:14.709
She's just not going... fast enough

126
00:05:14.785 --> 00:05:17.670
to, open up a time portal, so.

127
00:05:17.747 --> 00:05:20.331
How much champagne did you
have at Joe and Cecile's?

128
00:05:20.407 --> 00:05:23.375
This is the first opportunity I have

129
00:05:23.386 --> 00:05:26.670
to process my breakup with Gypsy, okay?

130
00:05:26.747 --> 00:05:28.214
How was I supposed to know

131
00:05:28.224 --> 00:05:29.715
that your future daughter

132
00:05:29.792 --> 00:05:31.342
was gonna come show up

133
00:05:31.418 --> 00:05:32.843
and crash my pity party?

134
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.061
How was I supposed to "ancipitate" that?

135
00:05:36.423 --> 00:05:37.899
Crap, I was supposed to meet Singh

136
00:05:37.975 --> 00:05:39.475
- at CCPD an hour ago.
- Okay.

137
00:05:39.551 --> 00:05:40.902
Hey, Wally, can you do me a favor?

138
00:05:40.978 --> 00:05:42.228
Can you take the sample to the Legends

139
00:05:42.238 --> 00:05:43.437
to see if they have any insight?

140
00:05:43.448 --> 00:05:44.730
And maybe, worst comes to worst,

141
00:05:44.741 --> 00:05:45.907
we can take her home on the Waverider?

142
00:05:45.983 --> 00:05:47.074
- Yeah, I got it.
- All right.

143
00:05:49.228 --> 00:05:51.654
Okay, just... I'll hurry back.

144
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.414
Keep an eye on her.

145
00:06:01.257 --> 00:06:03.749
New ID, keys to the lab.

146
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.427
You are officially reinstated
as our CSI tech, Allen.

147
00:06:06.504 --> 00:06:07.845
Thanks, Captain.

148
00:06:07.922 --> 00:06:10.381
One more thing.

149
00:06:10.457 --> 00:06:12.675
We didn't fill your position
while you were away,

150
00:06:12.751 --> 00:06:16.020
so there are a few cases
waiting for you in your lab.

151
00:06:16.097 --> 00:06:18.055
Get to them fast as you can.

152
00:06:18.132 --> 00:06:19.890
Welcome back, Allen.

153
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.948
"A few"?

154
00:06:29.351 --> 00:06:30.693
What you working on?

155
00:06:30.769 --> 00:06:33.955
- I don't...
- You are crazy behind.

156
00:06:34.031 --> 00:06:36.073
Hey, so I thought you were
gonna stay at STAR Labs,

157
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.575
with, with your...

158
00:06:38.652 --> 00:06:40.452
Iris... mom.

159
00:06:40.463 --> 00:06:42.204
Your mom.

160
00:06:42.281 --> 00:06:43.923
You know I'm a forensic scientist too?

161
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.968
CCU grad, just like you. 5.6 GPA.

162
00:06:47.044 --> 00:06:48.585
I could help you get through this.

163
00:06:48.662 --> 00:06:50.421
I don't know. I mean, it's...

164
00:06:51.841 --> 00:06:54.800
So the fire marshal at this site says

165
00:06:54.811 --> 00:06:58.262
crazing in the melted glass
suggests a liquid accelerant.

166
00:06:58.339 --> 00:07:01.056
Any petroleum-based household product

167
00:07:01.133 --> 00:07:02.975
could cause crazing.

168
00:07:02.986 --> 00:07:05.894
Well, like floor wax, or
shag rugs, even balloons.

169
00:07:05.971 --> 00:07:08.731
Yeah, the glass melts under the surface,

170
00:07:08.807 --> 00:07:12.827
like ice cream in the
cracks of a waffle cone.

171
00:07:12.903 --> 00:07:15.112
Like when you get two scoops

172
00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:17.456
of cookie dough ice cream
with extra sprinkles

173
00:07:17.533 --> 00:07:19.408
at the Mason Family Ice Cream Shop in...

174
00:07:19.485 --> 00:07:21.660
Happy Harbor, Rhode Island.

175
00:07:27.701 --> 00:07:31.462
My parents used to take me
there when I was a kid.

176
00:07:31.538 --> 00:07:33.339
It's my favorite dessert.

177
00:07:33.415 --> 00:07:34.631
Mine too.

178
00:07:38.504 --> 00:07:40.262
Hey, look, I'm sorry, you're obviously

179
00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:43.024
good at forensics, but
you shouldn't interfere.

180
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.269
I mean, people like us, we
need to be responsible.

181
00:07:47.346 --> 00:07:49.646
Right! Timeline.

182
00:07:49.723 --> 00:07:50.856
The timeline, yeah.

183
00:07:50.867 --> 00:07:52.316
All available units,

184
00:07:52.393 --> 00:07:53.942
M-0-3 in progress, 10th and Neely.

185
00:07:54.019 --> 00:07:55.944
M-0-3. that's a meta attack.

186
00:07:56.021 --> 00:07:57.446
Yeah, my suit's all torn up.

187
00:07:57.523 --> 00:07:59.114
I don't have anything to...

188
00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:01.158
Direct from Cisco's back closet.

189
00:08:01.235 --> 00:08:04.370
One first-edition red
emblem OG super suit.

190
00:08:04.446 --> 00:08:06.288
Total fan favorite.

191
00:08:06.365 --> 00:08:07.965
Thank you.

192
00:08:08.042 --> 00:08:10.667
I'm... I'm gonna handle this.

193
00:08:10.744 --> 00:08:11.668
You just... no, no, no.

194
00:08:11.745 --> 00:08:14.963
You... stay.

195
00:08:14.974 --> 00:08:16.265
Okay? Okay.

196
00:08:16.342 --> 00:08:17.841
Seriously, please.

197
00:08:17.852 --> 00:08:20.135
Now I'm gonna...

198
00:08:40.249 --> 00:08:41.949
Going old-school today, Flash?

199
00:08:42.025 --> 00:08:44.418
Yeah, it's a little tighter
than I remember, though.

200
00:08:54.505 --> 00:08:56.547
Hey, you might want to do something.

201
00:08:56.623 --> 00:09:00.426
Now it's my turn, Flash.

202
00:09:00.502 --> 00:09:03.554
Gridlock? Schway!

203
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.888
- What are you doing?
- No, no.

204
00:09:04.965 --> 00:09:06.932
I just... I just wanted...

205
00:09:11.805 --> 00:09:13.105
Nice.

206
00:09:32.073 --> 00:09:34.373
Grife. You're mad at me.

207
00:09:34.384 --> 00:09:36.918
No, Nora, we're not. We're just...

208
00:09:36.928 --> 00:09:38.461
Please don't say "disappointed."

209
00:09:38.471 --> 00:09:39.971
That's so much worse.

210
00:09:40.048 --> 00:09:41.681
I mean, I just didn't
think it was a big deal.

211
00:09:41.758 --> 00:09:43.507
It was only Gridlock.

212
00:09:43.584 --> 00:09:44.884
Gridlock?

213
00:09:44.895 --> 00:09:47.457
Boy, the future's got some great names.

214
00:09:47.755 --> 00:09:49.055
This lighting!

215
00:09:49.065 --> 00:09:50.773
How did you know who he is?

216
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.016
Flash Museum.

217
00:09:52.093 --> 00:09:53.601
Did you say...

218
00:09:53.678 --> 00:09:55.394
- "Flash Museum"?
- Yeah.

219
00:09:55.405 --> 00:09:58.981
It has all the villains and
battles in chronological order.

220
00:09:59.058 --> 00:10:00.658
I've studied everything.

221
00:10:01.653 --> 00:10:03.402
So you know this guy's real name?

222
00:10:03.413 --> 00:10:05.238
Mr. Myles, the curator,

223
00:10:05.314 --> 00:10:07.582
he scrubbed all the
names for legal reasons.

224
00:10:07.659 --> 00:10:08.991
But it really shouldn't matter.

225
00:10:09.002 --> 00:10:11.419
I mean, Gridlock was a one-and-done.

226
00:10:11.496 --> 00:10:13.412
You guys beat him in one try,

227
00:10:13.423 --> 00:10:16.082
or at least... you were supposed to.

228
00:10:16.092 --> 00:10:18.584
Now, because of me, he's on the run,

229
00:10:18.661 --> 00:10:20.878
and the timeline's all
messed up again, and I...

230
00:10:20.955 --> 00:10:22.713
Nora, hey, look, look.

231
00:10:22.724 --> 00:10:25.925
I've made way bigger mistakes
than this time traveling.

232
00:10:25.936 --> 00:10:27.843
We'll get this guy... you don't
need to worry about that...

233
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.604
but the longer you stay here,
the more things might change.

234
00:10:29.681 --> 00:10:31.013
We need to get you home.

235
00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.349
But I can't go fast enough to get home.

236
00:10:34.927 --> 00:10:36.402
What about the tachyon
absorption enhancer?

237
00:10:36.479 --> 00:10:38.229
The one that Thawne used
to increase his speed?

238
00:10:38.306 --> 00:10:39.948
Ooh, and if we charge it up,

239
00:10:40.024 --> 00:10:42.108
we could boost the Speed
Force in her cells,

240
00:10:42.118 --> 00:10:44.360
like some kind of...

241
00:10:44.437 --> 00:10:46.028
thing that boosts Speed Force in cells.

242
00:10:46.105 --> 00:10:47.530
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's a good idea.

243
00:10:47.606 --> 00:10:49.198
Let's... okay, finding Gridlock

244
00:10:49.275 --> 00:10:51.209
and getting Nora home need
to be our priorities.

245
00:10:51.286 --> 00:10:53.452
No, no, no. Stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

246
00:10:53.463 --> 00:10:55.171
Wait. Loud!

247
00:10:55.248 --> 00:10:59.375
Okay, so... but this needs
to be our priority.

248
00:10:59.452 --> 00:11:01.294
Now, I realize that you're
all way ahead of me

249
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:02.962
in this time-travel business, but guys,

250
00:11:03.039 --> 00:11:04.264
I think I just discovered something.

251
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.465
So if... if Nora can time travel,

252
00:11:06.542 --> 00:11:09.802
that means she can create
new timelines, right?

253
00:11:09.813 --> 00:11:14.557
New timelines means that
parallel timelines can exist.

254
00:11:14.567 --> 00:11:20.571
So, guys, I think that a whole
other universe could exist.

255
00:11:20.648 --> 00:11:21.939
I know, I know, I know.

256
00:11:22.016 --> 00:11:23.566
It sounds crazy, but think about it.

257
00:11:23.642 --> 00:11:26.569
There could be an Earth
where we're all bad guys,

258
00:11:26.645 --> 00:11:29.289
or another Earth where
there's no world hunger,

259
00:11:29.365 --> 00:11:31.991
or... or another Earth where...

260
00:11:32.002 --> 00:11:35.244
where they never made that
last "Indiana Jones" movie.

261
00:11:35.321 --> 00:11:37.580
Think of the possibilities.

262
00:11:37.656 --> 00:11:39.749
It's like some kind of a manyverse.

263
00:11:41.919 --> 00:11:45.087
And everybody knows about the manyverse.

264
00:11:45.164 --> 00:11:48.341
Multiverse, and so do you, Ralph.

265
00:11:48.417 --> 00:11:50.801
Breacher? Gypsy? Harry?

266
00:11:50.878 --> 00:11:51.969
What did you think we meant when we said

267
00:11:52.046 --> 00:11:53.596
Harry was from Earth-2?

268
00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:56.474
That he is from Earth "also."

269
00:11:56.484 --> 00:11:58.184
Oh, my God.

270
00:11:58.194 --> 00:11:59.769
You guys really need to make,
like, a welcome pamphlet,

271
00:11:59.845 --> 00:12:01.604
or at least a Powerpoint or something.

272
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.531
Hey, Ralph, buddy?

273
00:12:03.608 --> 00:12:05.816
Can we get off time
travel, maybe, please?

274
00:12:05.893 --> 00:12:07.485
Let's focus on finding
Gridlock, all right?

275
00:12:07.561 --> 00:12:08.652
Thank you.

276
00:12:08.729 --> 00:12:09.820
I'm gonna go to CCPD,

277
00:12:09.897 --> 00:12:11.205
see what I can dig up.

278
00:12:11.282 --> 00:12:12.448
Okay, I'll stay with Nora.

279
00:12:12.459 --> 00:12:14.367
- Let's just make sure...
- I know.

280
00:12:14.377 --> 00:12:16.369
Protect the timeline.

281
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.540
You thirsty?

282
00:12:23.494 --> 00:12:28.464
Okay, latte for me, and
a decaf Flash for you.

283
00:12:30.301 --> 00:12:32.843
Dad's lightning bolt is way
cooler than Lightning Lad's.

284
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.064
And do you think he's
gonna be back soon?

285
00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.848
Well, you know your dad.

286
00:12:37.925 --> 00:12:40.401
Whenever there's a problem,
he's gotta run off and fix it.

287
00:12:42.721 --> 00:12:44.063
But, you know,

288
00:12:44.074 --> 00:12:47.575
this gives us a chance to connect.

289
00:12:49.746 --> 00:12:52.405
You're not worried about
messing things up, like he is?

290
00:12:52.415 --> 00:12:55.324
I... well, I just, I...

291
00:12:55.401 --> 00:12:56.909
want to get to know you a little.

292
00:12:58.830 --> 00:12:59.912
How about this?

293
00:12:59.989 --> 00:13:01.756
I will ask you questions

294
00:13:01.833 --> 00:13:04.708
about your life, and if I'm right,

295
00:13:04.785 --> 00:13:07.503
you just blink twice.

296
00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.880
I mean, blinking never
broke the timeline, right?

297
00:13:09.957 --> 00:13:12.216
Okay, yeah, I mean, if
you really want to.

298
00:13:12.293 --> 00:13:14.218
Yeah, I think it'll be really fun.

299
00:13:14.295 --> 00:13:16.554
Okay, so let's see.

300
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.891
You are a reporter for a newspaper

301
00:13:20.968 --> 00:13:23.519
that you can only read on Instagram.

302
00:13:25.806 --> 00:13:28.899
Okay, you... you are a cop.

303
00:13:31.287 --> 00:13:33.788
You're a... a CSI?

304
00:13:35.959 --> 00:13:38.033
You're a CSI.

305
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.953
Just like your dad.

306
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.456
Okay, well, what about you and I?

307
00:13:43.532 --> 00:13:46.292
Do we... do we, like,
have dinner every Sunday?

308
00:13:46.302 --> 00:13:47.751
Do we talk on the phone?

309
00:13:47.828 --> 00:13:49.637
Do we still get coffee at Jitters?

310
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.924
Was that a blink?

311
00:13:54.001 --> 00:13:57.386
No, I just... I have
something in my eye.

312
00:13:59.107 --> 00:14:03.267
You know, a coffee in my time
at Jitters is $43 a cup.

313
00:14:03.344 --> 00:14:04.435
That's one thing

314
00:14:04.512 --> 00:14:05.653
I really like about now.

315
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.730
2018 is way schway.

316
00:14:07.806 --> 00:14:09.607
"Schway"?

317
00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:11.492
Yeah, I guess it's a future thing.

318
00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:14.069
Oh... oh, no. Oh, "schway."

319
00:14:14.146 --> 00:14:15.821
No, I know, I'm hip. I
know what schway means.

320
00:14:15.832 --> 00:14:18.240
Like, I'm schway, you're schway.

321
00:14:18.317 --> 00:14:20.826
We're... we're schway, baby.

322
00:14:23.113 --> 00:14:24.672
Stupid.

323
00:14:24.749 --> 00:14:27.500
Do you think maybe Caitlin
and Cisco need any help?

324
00:14:32.682 --> 00:14:35.049
I can't believe I'm wearing
the same tachyon enhancer

325
00:14:35.059 --> 00:14:37.510
my dad used to meet Supergirl
for the first time.

326
00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.094
All set.

327
00:14:39.171 --> 00:14:41.689
Wait, what happened to
the second version?

328
00:14:41.766 --> 00:14:43.191
The smaller one that
was inside the emblem

329
00:14:43.267 --> 00:14:45.100
of my dad's second suit?

330
00:14:45.177 --> 00:14:47.311
If he wore that one, he
could harness tachyons

331
00:14:47.388 --> 00:14:48.479
and share them with me.

332
00:14:48.556 --> 00:14:50.364
Hey, fangirl, relax.

333
00:14:50.441 --> 00:14:51.690
We know.

334
00:14:51.701 --> 00:14:53.609
Did all these suits shrink?

335
00:14:53.686 --> 00:14:55.778
And why does it smell so bad?

336
00:14:55.854 --> 00:14:57.655
Because it's the one you used

337
00:14:57.731 --> 00:14:59.990
when you swam against King Shark.

338
00:15:00.067 --> 00:15:01.542
Yeah, yeah.

339
00:15:01.619 --> 00:15:03.160
Flash!

340
00:15:03.237 --> 00:15:04.378
Zoom wants you dead!

341
00:15:04.455 --> 00:15:06.121
Yeah, yeah.

342
00:15:06.198 --> 00:15:07.998
I know King Shark is
technically a bad guy,

343
00:15:08.075 --> 00:15:10.125
but you should see... just wait.

344
00:15:10.136 --> 00:15:12.053
When he fights Grodd, it's...

345
00:15:12.129 --> 00:15:13.721
Spoiler alert.

346
00:15:15.124 --> 00:15:18.217
We should get going, actually, let's...

347
00:15:18.228 --> 00:15:19.301
Right.

348
00:15:19.378 --> 00:15:21.804
Then this is goodbye.

349
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.015
From your guys' perspectives, at least.

350
00:15:25.026 --> 00:15:28.069
I'll see you again in a
minute and 27 seconds,

351
00:15:28.145 --> 00:15:30.905
but when you see me
again, I'll be a baby.

352
00:15:30.982 --> 00:15:32.523
Get home safe, Nora.

353
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.066
I'm sorry

354
00:15:34.077 --> 00:15:35.192
we didn't get to spend
more time together.

355
00:15:35.203 --> 00:15:36.569
It's fine, Mom.

356
00:15:36.579 --> 00:15:38.404
We spend our whole lives together.

357
00:15:46.163 --> 00:15:47.255
All right.

358
00:16:11.847 --> 00:16:13.063
Did they already leave?

359
00:16:13.074 --> 00:16:14.356
Yeah, why? What's up?

360
00:16:14.433 --> 00:16:15.575
We have to stop them.

361
00:16:40.814 --> 00:16:42.514
I'm sorry I was too late.

362
00:16:42.524 --> 00:16:43.690
It took me a while to find
where the Legends were.

363
00:16:43.767 --> 00:16:45.058
Well, when they were.

364
00:16:45.135 --> 00:16:46.601
But we got their Gideon

365
00:16:46.678 --> 00:16:48.269
to scan Nora's blood sample.

366
00:16:48.346 --> 00:16:51.606
- What'd she find?
- Negative tachyons.

367
00:16:51.683 --> 00:16:53.492
Negative tachyons?

368
00:16:53.568 --> 00:16:55.911
So, what, instead of speeding
you up, they slow you down?

369
00:16:57.614 --> 00:16:58.830
Yeah.

370
00:16:58.907 --> 00:17:00.165
Damn, I was just joking.

371
00:17:00.242 --> 00:17:01.783
That's a real thing?

372
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.410
Yeah, Ava and her team
at the Time Bureau

373
00:17:03.486 --> 00:17:04.995
have encountered them
before, but no one knows

374
00:17:05.005 --> 00:17:06.997
where they come from or
how they're generated.

375
00:17:07.073 --> 00:17:09.833
Like dark matter for the
space time continuum.

376
00:17:09.843 --> 00:17:12.344
Exactly, and they're
saturating Nora's body

377
00:17:12.421 --> 00:17:14.254
and keeping her from
entering the Speed Force.

378
00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:16.589
What about the Waverider? Can
the Legends take her back?

379
00:17:16.666 --> 00:17:18.425
If negative tachyons come anywhere near

380
00:17:18.501 --> 00:17:19.843
the Rider's time drives,

381
00:17:19.853 --> 00:17:22.012
the reaction will vaporize the ship.

382
00:17:22.022 --> 00:17:23.555
Well, there's got to be a way
to get rid of them, right?

383
00:17:23.565 --> 00:17:24.973
I mean, I don't know about
getting rid of them,

384
00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.025
but maybe we can offset

385
00:17:27.102 --> 00:17:28.893
the tachyon absorption enhancer

386
00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:31.279
to negate the reaction somehow.

387
00:17:31.356 --> 00:17:33.198
- A new meta was last seen...
- Hey, guys.

388
00:17:33.275 --> 00:17:34.774
Jumping off a building in order to

389
00:17:34.851 --> 00:17:36.526
evade capture after stealing...

390
00:17:36.537 --> 00:17:37.861
How did we miss this?

391
00:17:39.606 --> 00:17:41.865
I guess this is a parting
gift from DeVoe.

392
00:17:41.875 --> 00:17:43.575
Without our STAR Labs
satellite, we've lost

393
00:17:43.585 --> 00:17:45.544
our eyes, our ears, our
dark matter scanner,

394
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.212
our facial recognition...
I mean, we're always

395
00:17:47.289 --> 00:17:48.621
gonna be one step
behind these metas now.

396
00:17:48.698 --> 00:17:50.040
I'll work on this.

397
00:17:50.116 --> 00:17:51.291
Why don't you guys go help Ralph

398
00:17:51.367 --> 00:17:52.292
with the Gridlock crime scene, okay?

399
00:17:52.368 --> 00:17:53.376
I can come help.

400
00:17:53.453 --> 00:17:55.420
Please, no, just... we just

401
00:17:55.497 --> 00:17:56.722
can't let this get any worse, all right?

402
00:17:59.468 --> 00:18:01.051
Just relax, okay?

403
00:18:03.472 --> 00:18:05.055
How's your investigation going?

404
00:18:05.065 --> 00:18:06.848
It just doesn't really add up.

405
00:18:06.925 --> 00:18:08.975
I mean, if Eddie wanted to
erase Thawne from existence,

406
00:18:09.052 --> 00:18:11.686
why didn't he just have a vasectomy?

407
00:18:11.763 --> 00:18:13.646
Right, nobody's talking.

408
00:18:13.723 --> 00:18:15.065
Probably because they're afraid

409
00:18:15.075 --> 00:18:16.733
Gridlock will attack them.

410
00:18:16.744 --> 00:18:19.069
Right, but maybe if I had
Killer Frost at my side,

411
00:18:19.079 --> 00:18:20.412
people would be a little more willing

412
00:18:20.489 --> 00:18:22.113
to tell us what they know.

413
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:24.574
Ralph, Killer Frost has been gone

414
00:18:24.585 --> 00:18:26.993
since the night that DeVoe
took over your body.

415
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:29.755
Jeez Louise, no one tells me anything.

416
00:18:29.831 --> 00:18:31.539
Is she gone for good? I hope not.

417
00:18:31.616 --> 00:18:33.249
But I've tried everything I can think of

418
00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.593
to get her to reappear.

419
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:36.261
You don't have any other leads?

420
00:18:38.581 --> 00:18:40.265
Cisco vibed me back to when

421
00:18:40.342 --> 00:18:42.425
Killer Frost and I were younger.

422
00:18:42.436 --> 00:18:44.052
You've been a meta since you were a kid?

423
00:18:44.129 --> 00:18:45.595
- I guess so.
- How?

424
00:18:45.606 --> 00:18:48.181
- I have no idea.
- Did you see anything else?

425
00:18:48.258 --> 00:18:51.101
- Just that my dad was there.
- Well, that's something.

426
00:18:51.111 --> 00:18:53.019
Except my dad's been dead for years.

427
00:18:53.096 --> 00:18:54.687
But none of this matters right now.

428
00:18:54.764 --> 00:18:57.783
We have much more pressing
things to deal with.

429
00:18:57.859 --> 00:18:59.785
Hey, come look at this.

430
00:18:59.861 --> 00:19:01.444
I present Gridlock.

431
00:19:01.455 --> 00:19:03.113
A mystery in three acts.

432
00:19:03.123 --> 00:19:04.956
Please note the dark matter levels.

433
00:19:05.033 --> 00:19:08.293
Act One, Gridlock attacks the
cops before Barry shows up.

434
00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:09.869
Okay, but these dark matter levels

435
00:19:09.946 --> 00:19:11.296
are perfectly normal
for a man of his size.

436
00:19:11.373 --> 00:19:14.249
Until Act Two.

437
00:19:14.325 --> 00:19:16.960
He gets lightning punched by Barry.

438
00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:18.795
His dark matter levels increased.

439
00:19:18.806 --> 00:19:21.756
Which brings us to our
third and final act...

440
00:19:23.835 --> 00:19:25.218
Gridlock hits back.

441
00:19:25.295 --> 00:19:26.427
Even higher.

442
00:19:26.504 --> 00:19:27.929
How... how is that possible?

443
00:19:28.006 --> 00:19:30.557
It isn't, unless every
time Gridlock got hit,

444
00:19:30.633 --> 00:19:32.317
his cells absorbed the kinetic energy.

445
00:19:32.394 --> 00:19:34.319
That would increase his
dark matter quotient,

446
00:19:34.396 --> 00:19:36.229
thereby increasing his powers.

447
00:19:36.306 --> 00:19:39.524
If this is true, then whatever
movement he's exposed to...

448
00:19:39.601 --> 00:19:41.192
The stronger he's gonna get.

449
00:19:41.269 --> 00:19:44.996
So, if Gridlock keeps moving,
he becomes unstoppable.

450
00:19:53.698 --> 00:19:56.249
So, figure it out yet?

451
00:19:56.326 --> 00:19:57.876
Whatever these negative tachyons are,

452
00:19:57.886 --> 00:19:59.419
it feels a lot more like science fiction

453
00:19:59.495 --> 00:20:00.846
than actual science.

454
00:20:00.922 --> 00:20:02.797
I wasn't asking about the science.

455
00:20:02.874 --> 00:20:05.559
I was asking about the scientist.

456
00:20:06.928 --> 00:20:09.929
You and Nora, you guys have
such a strong connection.

457
00:20:10.006 --> 00:20:12.599
I mean, it's... it's effortless.

458
00:20:12.675 --> 00:20:16.186
So why are you so intent
on sending her back?

459
00:20:16.196 --> 00:20:18.354
I mean, what do you mean?

460
00:20:18.365 --> 00:20:20.690
First of all, she can't stop
talking about the future.

461
00:20:20.701 --> 00:20:24.652
But... I mean, you know the
danger that her being here

462
00:20:24.729 --> 00:20:26.196
poses to the timeline.

463
00:20:26.206 --> 00:20:29.991
Yeah, I do, but I also know you, Barry.

464
00:20:31.453 --> 00:20:34.871
Look.

465
00:20:34.882 --> 00:20:36.706
You're the guy that went back in time

466
00:20:36.717 --> 00:20:38.717
to borrow Snart before he died. I know.

467
00:20:38.793 --> 00:20:41.628
You're also the same guy
that travelled to 2020

468
00:20:41.704 --> 00:20:45.465
to figure out who Savitar was,
and 2015 to train with Wells.

469
00:20:45.541 --> 00:20:50.011
You changed fate to save my life.

470
00:20:50.088 --> 00:20:52.847
So, now that our daughter
is here in front of us,

471
00:20:52.924 --> 00:20:54.849
asking for our help, you
expect me to believe

472
00:20:54.926 --> 00:20:56.568
that you're worried about the timeline?

473
00:20:56.645 --> 00:20:58.770
Nora shouldn't be here.

474
00:20:58.846 --> 00:21:00.647
Look, I'm...

475
00:21:00.723 --> 00:21:03.742
I've always wanted a family. I know.

476
00:21:03.818 --> 00:21:05.577
You know, and when we got married,

477
00:21:05.654 --> 00:21:09.739
I knew that one day, we'd
decide to have a baby.

478
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:14.661
We would try, and you'd get pregnant.

479
00:21:14.737 --> 00:21:18.423
I'd be there for the sonogram,
I'd hear her first heartbeat,

480
00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.250
and then she'd come.

481
00:21:20.326 --> 00:21:24.045
And we'd take her home,
see her first smile,

482
00:21:24.122 --> 00:21:27.048
her first tooth, the first
time I read to her.

483
00:21:28.918 --> 00:21:31.102
Her first steps. The first time she ran.

484
00:21:32.964 --> 00:21:35.848
But her being here now,
don't you feel like

485
00:21:35.925 --> 00:21:37.600
we missed all those firsts?

486
00:21:37.611 --> 00:21:39.227
That we skipped all the good stuff?

487
00:21:39.304 --> 00:21:42.855
Baby, we will still have
all of those firsts.

488
00:21:42.932 --> 00:21:44.941
Just not in that order.

489
00:21:44.952 --> 00:21:47.235
But my whole life's been out of order.

490
00:21:47.312 --> 00:21:49.612
These powers, time travel...

491
00:21:49.623 --> 00:21:51.957
that's the reason my mom was killed,

492
00:21:52.033 --> 00:21:54.242
why I grew up with my dad in prison.

493
00:21:54.319 --> 00:21:56.628
They missed so many firsts.
They missed our wedding.

494
00:21:56.705 --> 00:21:58.371
I know.

495
00:22:01.209 --> 00:22:05.128
I don't know, I just thought
that when it was our turn

496
00:22:05.138 --> 00:22:08.715
to have a kid, that life would let us

497
00:22:08.791 --> 00:22:12.018
have this one little
thing the normal way.

498
00:22:12.095 --> 00:22:14.387
Just once.

499
00:22:14.464 --> 00:22:16.264
But we lost that chance.

500
00:22:16.341 --> 00:22:20.393
No, we're not losing anything
by having her here now.

501
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:23.313
We're only gaining
something extra, Barry.

502
00:22:23.323 --> 00:22:27.233
And look, if we figure this out,

503
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.068
I mean, by the time we do have a baby,

504
00:22:29.145 --> 00:22:33.239
we are gonna be the best parents ever.

505
00:22:33.316 --> 00:22:36.117
- Maybe you're right.
- I know I'm right.

506
00:22:38.363 --> 00:22:42.340
You're gonna be there to put
that quarter under her pillow,

507
00:22:42.417 --> 00:22:43.842
and you're gonna be there

508
00:22:43.918 --> 00:22:46.002
to drive her to her first day of school,

509
00:22:46.013 --> 00:22:50.340
and you're gonna be there
to cheer on her first run.

510
00:22:53.002 --> 00:22:56.596
And we are gonna have
all of those firsts.

511
00:22:56.672 --> 00:22:59.349
I promise.

512
00:22:59.359 --> 00:23:01.642
And think about it.

513
00:23:01.719 --> 00:23:06.197
We have a kid who defied
the laws of physics

514
00:23:06.274 --> 00:23:07.940
to hang out with her parents.

515
00:23:07.951 --> 00:23:10.985
I mean, that's pretty...
that's pretty schway.

516
00:23:13.707 --> 00:23:16.282
Yeah, as eager as she is, you'd
think that she's the one

517
00:23:16.359 --> 00:23:20.370
that grew up with a parent in...

518
00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.548
What's wrong?

519
00:23:23.625 --> 00:23:25.708
Nothing. Nothing.

520
00:23:25.719 --> 00:23:27.543
I'm... I'm gonna be right back.

521
00:23:45.405 --> 00:23:48.740
Nora.

522
00:23:51.319 --> 00:23:54.070
What happens to me in the future?

523
00:23:54.081 --> 00:23:56.915
You said that you spend your
whole life with your mom,

524
00:23:56.991 --> 00:24:00.660
but you didn't say the same for me.

525
00:24:00.736 --> 00:24:03.329
My poker face is that bad?

526
00:24:03.406 --> 00:24:05.748
I need to know.

527
00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:16.860
--

528
00:24:17.137 --> 00:24:19.095
How long?

529
00:24:24.883 --> 00:24:26.439
--

530
00:24:26.478 --> 00:24:29.225
---

531
00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.192
You never come back.

532
00:24:46.118 --> 00:24:48.860
How old were you when it happened?

533
00:24:48.936 --> 00:24:52.488
I was born, a few years
before you vanished,

534
00:24:52.565 --> 00:24:56.534
but I don't have any memories of you.

535
00:24:56.611 --> 00:24:58.745
So the wedding was...

536
00:24:58.821 --> 00:25:01.748
Was pretty much the
first time I met you.

537
00:25:01.824 --> 00:25:05.376
I'd imagined so many different
things to say to you.

538
00:25:05.453 --> 00:25:08.046
Still can't believe I went
with "Remember to say 'I do.'"

539
00:25:10.667 --> 00:25:13.593
I guess things don't always
go the way you plan them.

540
00:25:16.982 --> 00:25:19.057
You're not stuck here, are you?

541
00:25:25.824 --> 00:25:28.650
I found it in the museum archive.

542
00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:32.153
Negative tachyons, harnessed on demand.

543
00:25:32.164 --> 00:25:36.491
Really should work on
that poker face, I guess.

544
00:25:36.501 --> 00:25:37.992
This didn't have to be a secret.

545
00:25:38.003 --> 00:25:39.786
Why did you keep this from us?

546
00:25:39.862 --> 00:25:42.005
Because if you knew I
could have gone home,

547
00:25:42.082 --> 00:25:43.414
you would have sent me back

548
00:25:43.491 --> 00:25:45.416
the second I walked
into Grandpa's house.

549
00:25:45.493 --> 00:25:46.918
I mean, it's like you said, Dad.

550
00:25:46.994 --> 00:25:49.721
Speedsters have to be responsible.

551
00:25:49.798 --> 00:25:52.465
But... but I'm not responsible, am I?

552
00:25:52.542 --> 00:25:56.186
I'm... just selfish

553
00:25:56.262 --> 00:26:02.016
and really, really bad
at being a speedster.

554
00:26:02.027 --> 00:26:03.643
Nora, you're not bad.

555
00:26:06.031 --> 00:26:08.690
I mean, I can do some
cool things, you know?

556
00:26:08.766 --> 00:26:11.534
Sometimes, I run so fast,
I reverse time a bit,

557
00:26:11.611 --> 00:26:14.204
but I can't do the things you can.

558
00:26:16.357 --> 00:26:19.158
I don't even know how to phase yet.

559
00:26:22.905 --> 00:26:27.375
Guess there's only so much
you can learn from a museum.

560
00:26:27.386 --> 00:26:31.554
What about your mom?

561
00:26:31.631 --> 00:26:34.006
Yeah, I... she's around, you know?

562
00:26:34.083 --> 00:26:37.135
It's just... just me and her.

563
00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:39.679
I'm sorry.

564
00:26:39.756 --> 00:26:41.639
Yeah, I know.

565
00:26:41.716 --> 00:26:43.233
I shouldn't have lied.

566
00:26:43.309 --> 00:26:46.903
I just wanted to see you so badly

567
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.239
and spend a day with you.

568
00:26:49.315 --> 00:26:54.819
Go for a run for the
first time together.

569
00:26:54.896 --> 00:26:57.247
I missed all your firsts.

570
00:27:01.235 --> 00:27:04.412
I was so worried about
screwing up your childhood

571
00:27:04.423 --> 00:27:08.166
and screwing up our family, but...

572
00:27:08.242 --> 00:27:10.376
I'm not even there.

573
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:13.713
Barry, we need you in the Cortex.

574
00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:15.932
It's about Gridlock.

575
00:27:16.009 --> 00:27:18.760
- I...
- I'm fine.

576
00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:22.597
you need to go fix my mess,
and then I can go home.

577
00:27:31.933 --> 00:27:34.066
I scanned the crime scene
photos and got a match.

578
00:27:34.143 --> 00:27:36.277
This is not Lang's first rodeo.

579
00:27:36.288 --> 00:27:39.122
CCPD put out a warrant
for him for carjacking.

580
00:27:39.199 --> 00:27:40.615
He killed the whole crew inside.

581
00:27:40.691 --> 00:27:42.241
And now he absorbs kinetic energy?

582
00:27:42.318 --> 00:27:44.076
He only gets stronger if you punch him,

583
00:27:44.153 --> 00:27:45.795
you shoot him, you throw
him into traffic.

584
00:27:45.872 --> 00:27:47.246
Which could only make the traffic worse.

585
00:27:47.323 --> 00:27:49.123
God, I'd hate to be
stuck in that gridlock.

586
00:27:49.134 --> 00:27:52.794
Gridlock... Gridlock...

587
00:27:52.804 --> 00:27:55.171
I came up with the name.

588
00:27:55.248 --> 00:27:58.049
I am fortune's fool.

589
00:27:58.125 --> 00:28:02.094
So how do we find this guy
without Sally the satellite?

590
00:28:02.171 --> 00:28:05.139
We don't need a satellite
to hack a cell phone.

591
00:28:06.843 --> 00:28:09.819
And if we want to find his
cell phone, we'll find it...

592
00:28:11.656 --> 00:28:13.481
By the airport?

593
00:28:15.309 --> 00:28:18.194
Got it, 'cause he's on a
plane that just took off.

594
00:28:18.271 --> 00:28:20.947
Central City Air, flight number 5201.

595
00:28:21.023 --> 00:28:24.075
Why would he get on a plane?

596
00:28:24.151 --> 00:28:26.244
Because he's gonna crash it.

597
00:28:32.326 --> 00:28:34.418
We are currently
cruising at 34.000 feet.

598
00:28:34.495 --> 00:28:36.012
We anticipate a smooth landing,

599
00:28:36.089 --> 00:28:37.180
so sit back and enjoy...

600
00:28:37.257 --> 00:28:39.006
Excuse me, sir.

601
00:28:39.017 --> 00:28:40.675
If you could please fasten your seatbelt

602
00:28:40.685 --> 00:28:42.176
until we reach cruising altitude

603
00:28:42.187 --> 00:28:44.187
and the captain turns
off the seatbelt sign.

604
00:28:49.027 --> 00:28:51.018
Are you gonna buckle that thing in too?

605
00:28:52.656 --> 00:28:54.021
Well, it must be something priceless

606
00:28:54.098 --> 00:28:56.607
to get its own seat.

607
00:28:56.684 --> 00:28:58.693
Jewels, maybe.

608
00:29:25.453 --> 00:29:26.586
The plane just lost an engine.

609
00:29:26.663 --> 00:29:28.805
It's headed for downtown.

610
00:29:28.882 --> 00:29:30.715
If Gridlock takes out the other engine,

611
00:29:30.792 --> 00:29:32.216
the pilot won't be able
to avoid the buildings.

612
00:29:34.387 --> 00:29:36.054
Thousands of people will die.

613
00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:38.473
Not if you phase the plane
through the buildings.

614
00:29:38.483 --> 00:29:40.317
I read about you doing the same thing

615
00:29:40.393 --> 00:29:43.770
to a plane in the future when
you were fighting Mob Rule.

616
00:29:43.846 --> 00:29:46.648
Can you two do that?

617
00:29:46.658 --> 00:29:48.566
A plane?

618
00:29:48.643 --> 00:29:50.276
No... I mean, no, I don't think so.

619
00:29:50.353 --> 00:29:51.527
I mean, I think it's too big.

620
00:29:56.076 --> 00:29:57.742
The three of us.

621
00:29:57.819 --> 00:29:59.419
I mean, the three of us
might be able to do it.

622
00:29:59.496 --> 00:30:01.087
Well, I can't phase anything.

623
00:30:01.164 --> 00:30:04.341
I can't even phase myself,
let alone at G-Force.

624
00:30:04.417 --> 00:30:06.509
Wait, G-For... G-Force, that's it.

625
00:30:06.586 --> 00:30:08.252
The plane is still ascending.

626
00:30:08.329 --> 00:30:09.712
Once he blows up the other engine,

627
00:30:09.789 --> 00:30:11.756
it's gonna slow down and point downwards

628
00:30:11.833 --> 00:30:13.016
before it starts its descent.

629
00:30:13.093 --> 00:30:14.434
That'll give us about ten seconds

630
00:30:14.511 --> 00:30:16.302
of zero Gs on the plane. Yeah.

631
00:30:16.379 --> 00:30:17.595
And zero Gs means no kinetic energy,

632
00:30:17.672 --> 00:30:19.138
means Gridlock has no powers.

633
00:30:19.215 --> 00:30:21.015
Can you breach them onto the plane?

634
00:30:21.026 --> 00:30:22.192
A plane goes way too fast.

635
00:30:22.268 --> 00:30:23.643
I'd need to see it in person.

636
00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.269
- Then go.
- But I don't have a suit.

637
00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.946
I actually have a backup.

638
00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:32.035
I got more than just a list
of metas from that museum.

639
00:30:49.245 --> 00:30:51.504
Damn, Gina. I made that?

640
00:30:51.515 --> 00:30:53.390
Ryan Choi, actually.

641
00:30:53.466 --> 00:30:56.175
This is a supersuit.

642
00:30:56.252 --> 00:30:58.177
No offense. None taken.

643
00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.650
Guys, he just took out the other engine.

644
00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:15.987
You can do this.

645
00:31:21.995 --> 00:31:26.706
Don't drink and vibe. I
feel like I'm gonna hurl.

646
00:31:31.954 --> 00:31:33.096
It's slowing.

647
00:31:33.173 --> 00:31:34.764
Guys, you've got ten seconds.

648
00:31:37.084 --> 00:31:38.843
Ten.

649
00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.636
Nine.

650
00:31:40.713 --> 00:31:42.096
Eight.

651
00:31:42.107 --> 00:31:43.940
Seven.

652
00:31:44.017 --> 00:31:45.558
Six.

653
00:31:45.635 --> 00:31:47.935
Five.

654
00:31:47.946 --> 00:31:50.271
Four.

655
00:31:50.348 --> 00:31:52.615
Three.

656
00:31:52.692 --> 00:31:54.609
Two.

657
00:31:54.685 --> 00:31:55.660
One.

658
00:32:11.702 --> 00:32:13.961
Okay, everybody stay calm, all right?

659
00:32:13.972 --> 00:32:16.139
Just stay calm.

660
00:32:19.394 --> 00:32:20.426
All right, come on.

661
00:32:26.425 --> 00:32:28.267
Hey, take a wall, all right?

662
00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:31.562
We got this.

663
00:32:32.824 --> 00:32:34.232
Barry, hurry.

664
00:32:41.315 --> 00:32:43.741
- It's not working.
- What?

665
00:32:44.986 --> 00:32:46.577
I can't do this.

666
00:32:46.654 --> 00:32:49.339
All right, yes... listen
to me, just breathe.

667
00:32:51.167 --> 00:32:52.675
Feel the floor beneath your feet.

668
00:32:52.752 --> 00:32:54.293
Feel the rumble of the plane.

669
00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:55.920
Feel the air.

670
00:32:55.997 --> 00:32:58.422
Feel that wind on your face,

671
00:32:58.499 --> 00:33:00.183
and the lightning. And the lightning.

672
00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:02.811
Feel its electricity pumping
through your veins,

673
00:33:02.887 --> 00:33:04.512
traveling to every nerve in your body

674
00:33:04.523 --> 00:33:06.347
like a shock you never want to end.

675
00:33:06.358 --> 00:33:08.641
- You are no longer you now.
- You're no longer you.

676
00:33:08.718 --> 00:33:09.934
You're part of something greater.

677
00:33:10.011 --> 00:33:11.477
You're part of something greater.

678
00:33:11.554 --> 00:33:13.145
Part of the Speed Force.

679
00:33:13.222 --> 00:33:14.364
That's right.

680
00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.033
All right, it's ours.

681
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:18.693
Now, let's do it.

682
00:33:26.193 --> 00:33:28.494
Everybody hold on!

683
00:33:47.089 --> 00:33:49.682
Hold on!

684
00:34:06.233 --> 00:34:08.159
Are you okay?

685
00:34:10.237 --> 00:34:12.371
Nice.

686
00:34:16.285 --> 00:34:17.919
You phased.

687
00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:19.637
For the first time!

688
00:34:27.751 --> 00:34:29.867
Well, Gridlock's off to
Iron Heights' meta wing.

689
00:34:29.944 --> 00:34:33.246
Where he won't be moving
from for a very long time.

690
00:34:33.257 --> 00:34:35.090
Thanks to your help.

691
00:34:35.166 --> 00:34:37.041
I'm glad we got to team up.

692
00:34:37.118 --> 00:34:38.418
Me too.

693
00:34:38.428 --> 00:34:40.086
Ladies and gentleman,

694
00:34:40.097 --> 00:34:43.932
say hello to the tachyon
absorption enhancer 2.5.

695
00:34:44.009 --> 00:34:45.767
now complete with
completely recalibrated

696
00:34:45.844 --> 00:34:47.635
Time Bureau technology.

697
00:34:47.712 --> 00:34:50.221
We haven't tested it yet, but
it should counterbalance

698
00:34:50.298 --> 00:34:52.274
the negative tachyons in Nora's cells.

699
00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:53.933
Here you go, Billy Pilgrim.

700
00:34:53.944 --> 00:34:56.319
Consider yourself unstuck in time.

701
00:34:56.396 --> 00:34:58.113
So I can run home now?

702
00:34:58.189 --> 00:35:01.232
Or...

703
00:35:01.309 --> 00:35:03.818
maybe we hit pause on this thing.

704
00:35:03.895 --> 00:35:06.362
You want Nora to stay?

705
00:35:06.439 --> 00:35:08.781
Yeah, I thought

706
00:35:08.792 --> 00:35:10.408
getting her home was our priority.

707
00:35:10.485 --> 00:35:12.452
No, it is, I just...

708
00:35:12.528 --> 00:35:14.746
now, I'm thinking that
maybe we should make sure

709
00:35:14.822 --> 00:35:16.623
her powers are working correctly

710
00:35:16.633 --> 00:35:18.916
before we send her home.

711
00:35:18.993 --> 00:35:21.469
And what about the timeline?

712
00:35:21.546 --> 00:35:22.879
It's risky, but I don't know.

713
00:35:22.955 --> 00:35:24.881
I mean, Wally and I
were talking about it.

714
00:35:24.957 --> 00:35:26.600
Yeah, the Legends have a theory.

715
00:35:26.676 --> 00:35:29.427
There are some historical
events that are soft.

716
00:35:29.504 --> 00:35:30.812
Basically, you change those,

717
00:35:30.889 --> 00:35:32.647
it's not going to affect much else,

718
00:35:32.724 --> 00:35:34.307
like catching Gridlock late.

719
00:35:34.384 --> 00:35:36.151
And then, there are
those that are fixed.

720
00:35:36.227 --> 00:35:38.645
You mess with them, and
all sorts of craziness

721
00:35:38.721 --> 00:35:40.229
starts to happen.

722
00:35:40.306 --> 00:35:41.731
Like the night my mom died.

723
00:35:41.808 --> 00:35:44.618
Changing that created Flashpoint.

724
00:35:46.529 --> 00:35:49.322
It looks like Nora is gonna
need a place to stay.

725
00:35:49.333 --> 00:35:52.742
Yes, and I'll stay in the lounge.

726
00:35:52.819 --> 00:35:54.786
What lounge?

727
00:35:54.862 --> 00:35:56.338
This lounge.

728
00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:06.556
- Damn.
- Dad.

729
00:36:06.633 --> 00:36:09.008
- You found my spot.
- You knew about this?

730
00:36:09.019 --> 00:36:12.354
I've been napping in here since day one.

731
00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:15.807
Well, Nora was gonna stay here,

732
00:36:15.883 --> 00:36:17.525
if that's all right with you.

733
00:36:17.602 --> 00:36:22.355
Okay, well, now I can get
to know my granddaughter.

734
00:36:29.039 --> 00:36:31.948
I'm sorry, you met Elvis?

735
00:36:32.024 --> 00:36:33.825
Met him?

736
00:36:33.901 --> 00:36:37.045
Uncle Wally fought the
ghost of his twin brother.

737
00:36:37.122 --> 00:36:39.288
I, I went to a monastery,

738
00:36:39.365 --> 00:36:41.165
and I was trying to find myself,

739
00:36:41.242 --> 00:36:42.717
but I was really close.

740
00:36:42.794 --> 00:36:44.460
Then, the Legends came,
they swooped me up,

741
00:36:44.537 --> 00:36:47.004
and life got even more crazy.

742
00:36:47.081 --> 00:36:49.257
You want to go back, don't you?

743
00:36:49.267 --> 00:36:51.467
I can't. I mean, I just got here.

744
00:36:51.544 --> 00:36:54.387
I don't want to leave the team.
I don't want to leave you.

745
00:36:54.398 --> 00:37:00.235
Wally, everybody in this room
loves you, especially me.

746
00:37:00.311 --> 00:37:05.314
But you didn't finish
what you set out to do,

747
00:37:05.391 --> 00:37:08.526
and nobody's gonna get in your way.

748
00:37:10.238 --> 00:37:12.739
So promise me, when you find
what you're looking for,

749
00:37:12.749 --> 00:37:14.991
come back, or you're gonna have

750
00:37:15.067 --> 00:37:18.369
a very angry-looking dad
in your zen garden.

751
00:37:22.008 --> 00:37:23.666
Will you take care of him, XS?

752
00:37:23.743 --> 00:37:25.418
You got it, Kid Flash.

753
00:37:29.099 --> 00:37:31.099
You okay?

754
00:37:31.176 --> 00:37:33.176
Yeah.

755
00:37:33.252 --> 00:37:35.937
I thought I missed out on my
chance to connect with Nora,

756
00:37:36.014 --> 00:37:41.017
but now that she's staying,
I get another shot.

757
00:37:41.093 --> 00:37:43.019
If you could have seen
her on that plane,

758
00:37:43.095 --> 00:37:44.946
you'd know that you guys
are already connected.

759
00:37:45.023 --> 00:37:47.231
Really?

760
00:37:47.308 --> 00:37:51.277
She was fearless, just like you.

761
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:59.202
We have a daughter together. Yeah.

762
00:37:59.278 --> 00:38:02.580
We make a person.

763
00:38:02.657 --> 00:38:06.250
In the end, everything works out.

764
00:38:06.327 --> 00:38:08.419
We get our happy ending.

765
00:38:20.716 --> 00:38:21.724
Hey.

766
00:38:21.801 --> 00:38:23.601
If Barry can go back in time,

767
00:38:23.678 --> 00:38:26.938
why didn't he stop the
Thinker from killing me?

768
00:38:27.014 --> 00:38:28.272
Kidding, I'm kidding.

769
00:38:28.349 --> 00:38:29.482
Guys, I'm kidding.

770
00:38:29.493 --> 00:38:30.733
I realize that could have upset

771
00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:32.568
the delicate balance of the universe.

772
00:38:32.645 --> 00:38:33.995
Besides, if he did that, who knows?

773
00:38:34.072 --> 00:38:36.155
He might have created a timeline where

774
00:38:36.166 --> 00:38:38.500
I died in that particle
accelerator explosion.

775
00:38:38.576 --> 00:38:40.001
Wishful thinking.

776
00:38:40.078 --> 00:38:41.669
Kidding. I'm glad you're here,

777
00:38:41.746 --> 00:38:43.496
and I'm glad that we don't
have to hold your hand

778
00:38:43.507 --> 00:38:45.340
through the time travel thing;
you're figuring it out.

779
00:38:45.416 --> 00:38:48.009
Yeah, well, time travel's not
the only mystery I solved.

780
00:38:48.086 --> 00:38:49.085
While you guys were fighting Gridlock,

781
00:38:49.161 --> 00:38:52.463
I was, running this down.

782
00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:55.299
- What's this?
- An answer.

783
00:38:55.376 --> 00:38:57.134
And a lot more questions.

784
00:39:02.192 --> 00:39:04.859
It's my father's death certificate.

785
00:39:04.936 --> 00:39:07.028
A friend at county
helped me out with that.

786
00:39:07.105 --> 00:39:10.815
The ME who signed off
on it, Cameron Mahkent?

787
00:39:10.892 --> 00:39:12.692
He doesn't exist.

788
00:39:12.702 --> 00:39:14.452
So then, this death certificate...

789
00:39:14.529 --> 00:39:16.704
Is a fake.

790
00:39:20.535 --> 00:39:23.378
You should get some rest.
You've had a long day.

791
00:39:23.454 --> 00:39:24.996
Ooh, I'll try.

792
00:39:25.072 --> 00:39:27.123
I'm just so excited. Like, literally.

793
00:39:27.199 --> 00:39:29.551
Phasing excited all of the
electron clouds in my body.

794
00:39:29.627 --> 00:39:31.460
Well, if you're not tired,

795
00:39:31.537 --> 00:39:34.055
two scoops of cookie dough ice
cream sound good right now.

796
00:39:34.132 --> 00:39:35.214
From Happy Harbor?

797
00:39:35.225 --> 00:39:36.966
If that's okay with you.

798
00:39:38.603 --> 00:39:40.803
It is, yeah.

799
00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.565
Just, bring me back some mint chip.

800
00:39:50.389 --> 00:39:52.231
My name is Nora West Allen,

801
00:39:52.308 --> 00:39:54.400
and I'm the fastest woman alive.

802
00:39:54.411 --> 00:39:56.402
When I was a child,
my father disappeared

803
00:39:56.413 --> 00:39:58.195
in something impossible.

804
00:39:58.272 --> 00:40:01.749
Then I grew up and
became the impossible.

805
00:40:01.826 --> 00:40:04.619
Now I'm trying to live up
to the legacy he created

806
00:40:04.629 --> 00:40:07.663
so that one day, I'll stop
him from ever disappearing.

807
00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:09.757
I'm XS.

808
00:40:09.834 --> 00:40:12.093
How schway is that?

809
00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:45.910
CCPD! Stay where you are.

810
00:40:45.987 --> 00:40:47.462
Freeze, don't move.

811
00:41:18.403 --> 00:41:21.204
Who the hell are you?

812
00:41:24.316 --> 00:41:27.827
Wh... what do you want?

813
00:41:27.903 --> 00:41:31.664
For all of you to die.

814
